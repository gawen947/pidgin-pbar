Pidgin PBar
===========
This Pidgin plugin adds a toolbar to the buddy list to quickly update nickname,
personal message, icon, status and mood. It also allows updating the current
song and other parameters which are updated globally on all accounts that
support them.

INSTALLATION
============
You will need a C compiler like gcc, make and the following dependencies :

  - pidgin-dev
  - gtk2-dev
  - pkg-config

On Debian use the following command as root to install the required packages :

  # aptitude install pidgin-dev libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config make gcc libc6-dev

Then enter the following command :

  $ make
  $ sudo make install

This will install the plugin and locales.
The following flags are also available to enable/disable somes features :

  - DISABLE_NLS   (enabled by default)
  - DISABLE_DEBUG (enabled by default)

Please take advice that BSD make probably won't work, you need to use gmake 
instead.
